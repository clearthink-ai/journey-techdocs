# A Guide to Our Documentation

Welcome to the `journey-techdocs` repository! This guide explains how our technical documentation is organized. Our goal is to make it easy for any developer—student, contributor, or professional—to find what they need and understand how our platform works.

## Our Core Philosophy: First Principles Thinking

Our documentation is structured around a powerful mental model called **First Principles Thinking**.

The core idea is simple: instead of reasoning by analogy ("*this is how other platforms build a feature*"), we first break every problem down into its most fundamental truths. From there, we build our solutions **from the ground up**.

This documentation follows the same logic. It is designed to show you not just *what* we built, but to give you a clear, step-by-step understanding of *why* it was built that way, starting with its foundational principles.

## The Documentation Structure

This philosophy produces a consistent, four-layered documentation suite for each major feature or component. When you explore a feature, you can expect to find documents that answer four key questions:

### 1. The Foundation: Assumptions & Constraints

* **Question Answered:** "What were the rules and starting points?"
* **Purpose:** This document lists the basic rules we had to follow before we started building. It covers our **Assumptions** (what we believed to be true about the technology or user) and our **Constraints** (what we were not allowed to change, like the required technical stack).

### 2. The "Why": Vision & Goals

* **Question Answered:** "Why was this feature built?"
* **Purpose:** This explains the main goal of the feature. It answers the question, "What problem does this solve for the user?" and defines what a successful solution looks like.

### 3. The "What": Functional & UX Specification

* **Question Answered:** "How does the feature work for a user?"
* **Purpose:** This describes every user interaction. It explains what the user sees and does, often using user flows or stories. It's a blueprint of the feature's behavior, without any code.

### 4. The "How": Technical Design Guide

* **Question Answered:** "How does the code work?"
* **Purpose:** This is the guide for engineers. It explains the code's architecture, breaks down the important files and classes, and details how different parts of the system communicate with each other.

## How to Navigate This Repository

For any given feature, such as `/features/journey-story/`, you can expect to find these documents inside its dedicated `docs/` sub-folder. The files are usually numbered (e.g., `00_...`, `01_...`) to suggest a logical reading order.

This clear, layered structure is also highly effective for AI-assisted development, as it provides excellent context for an LLM to help with coding, debugging, and generating test cases.
